Marriage
by Marianne Moore

This institution,
perhaps one should say enterprise
out of respect for which
one says one need not change one's mind
about a thing one has believed in,
requiring public promises
of one's intention
to fulfill a private obligation:
I wonder what Adam and Eve
think of it by this time,
this fire-gilt steel
alive with goldenness;
how bright it shows---
``of circular traditions and impostures,
committing many spoils,''
requiring all one's criminal ingenuity
to avoid!
Psychology which explains everything
explains nothing,
and we are still in doubt.
Eve: beautiful woman---
I have seen her
when she was so handsome
she gave me a start,
able to write simultaneously
in three languages---
English, German, and French---
and talk in the meantime;
equally positive in demanding a commotion
and in stipulating quiet:
``_I_ should like to be alone'';
to which the visitor replies,
``I should like to be alone;
why not be alone together?''
Below the incandescent stars
below the incandescent fruit,
the strange experience of beauty;
its existence is too much;
it tears one to pieces
and each fresh wave of consciousness
is poison.
``See her, see her in this common world,''
the central flaw
in that first crystal-fine experiment,
this amalgamation which can never be more
than an interesting impossibility,
describing it
as ``that strange paradise
unlike flesh, stones,
gold or stately buildings,
the choicest piece of my life:
the heart rising
in its estate of peace
as a boat rises
with the rising of the water'';
constrained in speaking of the serpent---
shed snakeskin in the history of politeness
not to be returned to again---
that invaluable accident
exonerating Adam.
And he has beauty also;
it's distressing---the O thou
to whom from whom,
without whom nothing---Adam:
``something feline,
something colubrine''---how true!
a crouching mythological monster
in that Persian miniature of emerald mines,
raw silk---ivory white, snow white,
oyster white, and six others---
that paddock full of leopards and giraffes---
long lemon-yellow bodies
sown with trapezoids of blue.
Alive with words,
vibrating like a cymbal
touched before it has been struck,
he has prophesied correctly---
the industrious waterfall,
``the speedy stream
which violently bears all before it,
at one time silent as the air
and now powerful as the wind.''
``Treading chasms
on the uncertain footing of a spear,''
forgetting that there is in woman
a quality of mind
which as an instinctive manifestation
is unsafe,
he goes on speaking
in a formal customary strain,
of ``past states, the present state,
seals, promises,
the evil one suffered,
the good one enjoys,
hell, heaven,
everything convenient
to promote one's joy.''
In him a state of mind
perceives what it was not
intended that he should;
``he experiences a solemn joy
in seeing that he has become an idol.''
Plagued by the nightingale
in the new leaves,
with its silence---
not its silence but its silences,
he says of it:
``It clothes me with a shirt of fire.''
``He dares not clap his hands
to make it go on
lest it should fly off;
if he does nothing, it will sleep;
if he cries out, it will not understand.''
Unnerved by the nightingale
and dazzled by the apple,
impelled by ``the illusion of a fire
effectual to extinguish fire,''
compared with which
the shining of the earth
is but deformity---a fire
``as high as deep
as bright as broad
as long as life itself,''
he stumbles over marriage,
``a very trivial object indeed''
to have destroyed the attitude
in which he stood---
the ease of the philosopher
unfathered by a woman.
Unhelpful Hymen!
a kind of overgrown cupid
reduced to insignificance
by the mechanical advertising
parading as involuntary comment,
by that experiment of Adam's
with ways out but no way in---
the ritual of marriage,
augmenting all its lavishness;
its fiddlehead ferns,
lotus flowers, opuntias, white dromedaries,
its hippopotamus---
nose and mouth combined
in one magnificent hopper---
its snake and the potent apple.
He tells us
that ``for love that will
gaze an eagle blind,
that is with Hercules
climbing the trees
in the garden of the Hesperides,
from forty-five to seventy
is the best age,''
commending it
as a fine art, as an experiment,
a duty or as nearly recreation.
One must not call him ruffian
nor friction a calamity---
the fight to be affectionate:
``no truth can be fully known
until it has been tried
by the tooth of disputation.''
The blue panther with blue eyes,
entirely graceful---
one must give them the path---
the black obsidian Diana
who ``darkeneth her countenance
as a bear doth,''
the spiked hand
that has an affection for one
and proves it to the bone,
impatient to assure you
that impatience is the mark of independence,
not of bondage.
``Married people often look that way''---
``seldom and cold, up and down,
mixed and malarial
with a good day and a bad.''
We Occidentals are so unemotional,
self lost, the irony preserved
in ``the Ahasuerus _tête-à-tête_ banquet''
with its small orchids like snakes' tongues,
with its ``good monster, lead the way,''
with little laughter
and munificence of humor
in that quixotic atmosphere of frankness
in which ``four o'clock does not exist,
but at five o'clock
the ladies in their imperious humility
are ready to receive you'';
in which experience attests
that men have power
and sometimes one is made to feel it.
He says, ``What monarch would not blush
to have a wife
with hair like a shaving brush?''
The fact of woman
is ``not the sound of the flute
but very poison.''
She says, ``Men are monopolists
of `stars, garters, buttons
and other shining baubles'---
unfit to be the guardians
of another person's happiness.''
He says, ``These mummies
must be handled carefully---
`the crumbs from a lion's meal,
a couple of shins and the bit of an ear';
turn to the letter M
and you will find
that `a wife is a coffin,'
that sever object
with the pleasing geometry
stipulating space not people,
refusing to be buried
and uniquely disappointing,
revengefully wrought in the attitude
of an adoring child
to a distinguished parent.''
She says, ``This butterfly,
this waterfly, this nomad
that has `proposed
to settle on my hand for life'---
What can one do with it?
There must have been more time
in Shakespeare's day
to sit and watch a play.
You know so many artists who are fools.''
He says, ``You know so many fools
who are not artists.''
The fact forgot
that ``some have merely rights
while some have obligations,''
he loves himself so much,
he can permit himself
no rival in that love.
She loves herself so much,
she cannot see herself enough---
a statuette of ivory on ivory,
the logical last touch
to an expansive splendor
earned as wages for work done:
one is not rich but poor
when one can always seem so right.
What can one do for them---
these savages
condemned to disaffect
all those who are not visionaries
alert to undertake the silly task
of making people noble?
This model of petrine fidelity
who ``leaves her peaceful husband
only because she has seen enough of him''---
that orator reminding you,
``I am yours to command.''
``Everything to do with love is mystery:
it is more than a day's work
to investigate this science.''
One sees that it is rare---
that striking grasp of opposites
opposed each to the other, not to unity,
which in cycloid inconclusiveness
have dwarfed the demonstration
of Columbus with the egg---
a triumph of simplicity---
that charitive Euroclydon
of frightening disinsterestedness
which the world hates,
admitting:

        ``I am such a cow,
        if I had a sorrow
        I should feel it a long time;
        I am not one of those
        who have a great sorrow
        in the morning
        and a great joy at noon'';

which says: ``I have encountered it
among those unpretentious
protégés of wisdom,
where seeming to parade
as the debater and the Roman,
the statesmanship
of an archaic Daniel Webster
persists to their simplicity of temper
as the essence of the matter:

        `Liberty and union
        now and forever';

the Book on the writing-table;
the hand in the breast-pocket.''
